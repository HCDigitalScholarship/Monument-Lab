It can indicate the dates of equinoxes and solstices through the Zodiac. The \"Philadelphia Noon\" line could be realized in paint or in more permanent material. Because Broad St. is not aligned on a true N-S line, the shadow of Billy Penn will cross it sometime after LAN. The difference between LAN and the crossing of the shadow will vary by as much as half an hour, depending on time of year. \"Philadelphia Noon\" will connect the city and its citizens to the universe in which they live.

The project involved high school students partnering with architects and graphic designers to come up with an idea for the use of the hundreds of vacant lots in Philadelphia, specifically in the Kensington area. Winners received $2000 to use on one lot to make their project a reality. My project was called \"Tag You're It\", and it was about graffiti. I wanted to turn my lot into a blank white canvas, all walls completely white, the lot completely clean no longer filled with drug needles, broken bottles, overgrown weeds. The lot would be created for ALL local graffiti artists, youth, anyone at all, and they'd be able to graffiti, doodle, marker whatever they wanted on the wall. Too many young artists aren't able to freely express themselves because graffiti isn't considered art. It was given this negative connotation because often these artists have nowhere to put their art without it being considered illegal. I want to change that connotation. Art is expression for each and every individual, and they deserve this free space to express themselves. I was the winner of the project, but the company was put out of business before I could make my project a reality.

However, I also think that the universities represent a huge divide. University City sometimes feels like a bubble for students who don't always venture out. Additionally, while Philadelphia has a huge population of college students, only about 25% of Philadelphians graduate from college. The railway bridge near World Cafe Live has a really interesting aesthetic because of how the ivy grows up the sides. I propose to put vine arbors underneath on Walnut Street to make use of this natural decoration and to make the bridge to University City more inviting. This might cause college students to venture and learn more about the city, and invite more citizens into University City to make it feel less like an enclosed place.

Within 6 years, women won the right to vote and voted in the 1920 presidential election. Alice Paul gained her PhD in political science at the University of Pennsylvania on the topic of the political rights of women in Pennsylvania. After achieving votes for women, Alice Paul launched her campaign for an Equal Rights Amendment in 1923 and campaigned for its passage until her death.
